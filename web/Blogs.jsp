	<h3>Advice for Diabetes</h3>
        <h1 style="color:inherit;">10th October 2016 by Rupy Aujla</h1>
	<aside  style="border: 1px solid;border-radius: 20px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;padding: 20px;background-color:yellow;font-size: 20px;  "> DISCLAIMER ALERT! This post is not intended to treat, override the decision of your personal doctor or cater for all problems you may have. I strongly advise everyone, particularly those with pre-diabetes and diabetes, to discuss the below suggestions with their personal physician.</aside>
	<h2>1. REMOVE REFINED CARBOHYDRATES, SUGARS AND HIDDEN SUGARS</h2>

<p>I hate to start on a negative note, because I like to focus on the beauty of food and the medicinal effects of eating well, but nonetheless I think it?s important to tackle this right at the beginning.</p>
<ul>

     <li>Sugar (the white stuff)</li>
     <li>Juices</li>
    <li>1. REMOVE REFINED CARBOHYDRATES, SUGARS AND HIDDEN SUGARS</li>
    <li>Soda</li>  
    <li> White Rice</li> 
   <li>White Pasta</li>  
   <li>Bread (both whole and white)</li>
   <li> Sauces and condiments</li> 
   <li>Obvious stuff (sweets, chocolate bars, crisps, pastries, biscuits, sweet granola bars)</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. COLOURFUL PLANT FOCUSED FOOD</h2>	

<p>Every mealtime is an opportunity to flood your body with ingredients that have the ability to reduce inflammation, reduce stress and improve your wellbeing. Treat food like medicines ? don?t forget to take them. The compounds with the power to prevent, treat and reverse disease are found mostly in PLANTS. Phytochemicals like glucosinolates, polyphenols as well as traditional micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) are all found abundantly in colourful plant based food. As well as providing defence they increase your own body?s ability to tolerate the stresses of disease and modern living. This is why in countless studies, a diet consisting largely of vegetables shows not only a lower risk of disease, but the potential for reversal.</p>
<h2>3. DEFINED PERIODS OF EATING</h2>

<p>This is a real easy one to implement and amazingly effective. Please try this out. Only eat for defined periods of 10-12 hours in the day:

e.g If you wake up at 7am and eat at 8am, do not eat after 8pm. And try not to eat 2 hours before going to bed.</p>
<img style="width: 20%" src="images/time.jpg">
<p>Multiple studies demonstrate that having a defined period of eating leads to better weight control, better sugar control and improving markers of disease like insulin and fasting glucose levels. There are multiple theories ranging from clock genes to positive effects on the gut microbiome (more on that here). It basically gets your body to become used to when to expect food and improves the ability of your hormones to do their job. Very easy, very effective.</p>
<h2>4. WALK AFTER MEALS</h2>

<p>Again another REALLY EASY but effective way of improving your sugar control. Instead of ?vegging out? on the couch after eating (like we?re all guilty of, let?s be honest!) 15 minutes minimum walk after eating is what we should aim for. It?s a simple as that.</p>

<h4 style="font-size: 150%">Tips for Night Shift Workers</h4>
<h1>9th September 2016 by Rupy Aujla</h1>
<p>Before and after shifts, people often complain of abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, low mood and increased susceptibility to common viruses. Studies looking at brain waves show that sleep rhythms are incredibly important to health. Proper alignment influences metabolism, inflammation pathways and stress hormones. So it?s no wonder us night shift workers (I?m afraid to say) have a significantly shorter life expectancy than our 9-5 colleagues.</p><br>
<img style="width: 20%" src="images/night.jpg">
<p>1. I tend to have a low carbohydrate, high quality fat and protein rich meal before my shift starts e.g. Shakshuka eggs with olives and tons of greens.</p>
<br>
<p>2. Graze on nutrient dense, quality fat foods to keep you satiated

Toasted nuts and seeds ? experiment with spices, I like using caraway and cumin seeds that are great at settling your tummy as well
Kale chips ? easy to bake a whole batch to keep snacking on, your colleagues will love you for them
Baked avocado ? cover some slices in flaxseed crumb with cayenne and you?ve got a great high fat snack
Nut butters ? I?m addicted
Crudités with hummus/guacamole ? experiment with carrot, asparagus or whatever is in season
Dark berries ? low sugar, antioxidant rich and tasty
Popcorn with spices ? even though popcorn has low nutritional value, sometimes you just need to graze on anything that tastes good </p>
<img style="width: 20%" src="images/tea.jpg">
<br>
<p>3. If you find yourself desperate for a caffeine hit stick with Green Tea. Coffee raises your adrenaline levels that are already elevated, leading to high cortisol and insulin that leads to weight gain. Matcha tea naturally contains L-Theanine, an amino acid thought to be responsible for mitigating the anxiety promoting effects of caffeine. It?s also been shown in controlled studies to improve concentration .. so drink up!</p>
<br>
TOP TIP: ?I plan for a cup of tea about halfway through; so it?s enough to keep my energy level up for the rest of the shift, yet still allow me to sleep when I get home?
<br>
<p>4. Food to avoid

Sugary snacks
Processed foods
High Carb ? pasta, rice, bread
Soda, chocolate bars ? Cake (please stop eating cake at night)</p>
<br>
<p>5. Preparation is key to making sure you don?t reach for that cake somebody always brings in with the best intentions! Before you get your last sleep in, make sure your food is ready

TOP TIP: ?This is slightly sweeter than what I would recommend all of the time ? but dried coconut strips and Greek yogurt bites or Greek yogurt covered fruit sometimes makes me feel better when everyone else is eating cake!?</p>
